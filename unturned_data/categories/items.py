# This module previously contained per-type BundleEntry subclasses
# (Gun, MeleeWeapon, Consumeable, Clothing, Throwable, BarricadeItem,
# StructureItem, Magazine, Attachment).
#
# All type-specific data is now extracted via the properties system
# (see unturned_data.models.properties). This file is kept as a
# placeholder to avoid import errors from any stale references.
